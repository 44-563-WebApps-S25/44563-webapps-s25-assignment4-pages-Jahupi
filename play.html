        <h2>Winter's Tale</h2>
        <h3>Act 1, Scene 1</h3>

            <p class="stage-direction">SCENE I. Antechamber in LEONTES' palace.
                Enter CAMILLO and ARCHIDAMUS</p>
            <h4 class="name archidamus">ARCHIDAMUS</h4>
                <p class="speech">If you shall chance, Camillo, to visit Bohemia, on
                    the like occasion whereon my services are now on
                    foot, you shall see, as I have said, great
                    difference betwixt our Bohemia and your Sicilia.</p>
            <h4 class="name camillo">CAMILLO</h4>
                <p class="speech">I think, this coming summer, the King of Sicilia
                    means to pay Bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him.</p>
            <h4 class="name archidamus">ARCHIDAMUS</h4>
                <p class="speech">Wherein our entertainment shall shame us we will be
                    justified in our loves; for indeed--</p>
            <h4 class="name camillo">CAMILLO</h4>
                <p class="speech">Beseech you,--</p>
            <h4 class="name archidamus">ARCHIDAMUS</h4>
                <p class="speech">Verily, I speak it in the freedom of my knowledge:
                    we cannot with such magnificence--in so rare--I know
                    not what to say. We will give you sleepy drinks,
                    that your senses, unintelligent of our insufficience,
                    may, though they cannot praise us, as little accuse
                    us.</p>
            <h4 class="name camillo">CAMILLO</h4>
                <p class="speech">You pay a great deal too dear for what's 
                    given freely.</p>
            <h4 class="name archidamus">ARCHIDAMUS</h4>
                <p class="speech">Believe me, I speak as my understanding instructs me
                    and as mine honesty puts it to utterance.</p>
            <h4 class="name camillo">CAMILLO</h4>
                <p class="speech">Sicilia cannot show himself over-kind to Bohemia.
                    They were trained together in their childhoods; and
                    there rooted betwixt them then such an affection,
                    which cannot choose but branch now. Since their
                    more mature dignities and royal necessities made
                    separation of their society, their encounters,
                    though not personal, have been royally attorneyed
                    with interchange of gifts, letters, loving
                    embassies; that they have seemed to be together,
                    though absent, shook hands, as over a vast, and
                    embraced, as it were, from the ends of opposed
                    winds. The heavens continue their loves!</p>
            <h4 class="name archidamus">ARCHIDAMUS</h4>
                <p class="speech">I think there is not in the world either malice or
                    matter to alter it. You have an unspeakable
                    comfort of your young prince Mamillius: it is a
                    gentleman of the greatest promise that ever came
                    into my note.</p>
