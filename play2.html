        <h4 class="name camillo">CAMILLO</h4>
            <p class="speech">I very well agree with you in the hopes of him: it
                is a gallant child; one that indeed physics the
                subject, makes old hearts fresh: they that went on
                crutches ere he was born desire yet their life to
                see him a man.</p>
        <h4 class="name archidamus">ARCHIDAMUS</h4>
                <p class="speech">Would they else be content to die?</p>
        <h4 class="name camillo">CAMILLO</h4>
                <p class="speech">Yes; if there were no other excuse why they should
                    desire to live.</p>
        <h4 class="name archidamus">ARCHIDAMUS</h4>
                <p class="speech">If the king had no son, they would desire to live
                    on crutches till he had one.</p>
